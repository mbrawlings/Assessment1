// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "The process of defining user expectations for a new software being built or modified"
const design = "Figuring out what languages will be used, what software it will be on, and what platforms it will be used on"
const implementation = "Release it!"
const testingAndIntegration = "If it works, test it more. Test again. Test a few more times"
const maintain = "Maintain as software changes and evolves. Stay up to date to avoid bugs and crashes"
